# Strength-Training-Tracker
This project explores automated tracking of free weight exercises using wristband accelerometer and gyroscope data from 5 participants performing barbell exercises. Machine learning models are developed to identify exercises, count repetitions, and detect improper form, mimicking a personal trainer's role.
